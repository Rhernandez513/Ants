Welcome to the battlefield!


Here, on this kitchen table, the most epic battle between Ants is unfolding...





On one side, there are the BLUE ants.


The other side has RED Ants.


  They despise each other. . .





Each side has a hierarchy of ant ranks:


  Worker Ant, Soldier Ant, and Knight Ant, and the Queen...


(Press Enter to Continue...)


Every Ant starts out as a Worker Ant gains strength as they battle.


Queen Ants do not gain strength, but rather are the weakest Ant!





Stronger ants can easily defeat weaker ants, but they will surely be damaged


If there are two evenly matched ants, fate shall decide who wins, and who dies





Each side has a weak spot, their Queen.


To win, one colony must:


Either wipe out at least 90% of the other population.


Or destroy the opposing colony's Queen.





Are you ready..?  (Press Enter to Continue...)


How Large should the field of battle be?


The battlefield will be square with sides equal to your choice...
