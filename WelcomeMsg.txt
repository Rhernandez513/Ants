Welcome to the battlefield!
Here, on this kitchen table, the most epic battle between Ants is unfolding...

On one side, there are the BLUE ants.
The other side has RED Ants.
  They despise each other. . .

Each side has a hierarchy of ant ranks:
  Worker Ant, Soldier Ant, and Knight Ant, and the Queen...

Every Ant starts out as a Worker Ant gains strength as they battle.
Queen Ants do not gain strength, but rather are the weakest Ant!

Stronger ants can easily defeat weaker ants, but they will surely be damaged
If there are two evenly matched ants, fate shall decide who wins, and who dies

Each side has a weak spot, their Queen.
Whichever side defeats the other sides' Queen, wins the game!

Are you ready..?
